# What is KLIND OS

KLIND OS is Arch Linux distribution. But what is different that rest of the
Arch-based distributions? KLIND OS is written in JavaScript.

The GUI, the app manager and starter, the API for creating external applications and rest is written in JavaScript.

# But why?

Why not. But the actual reason is that I wanted to create really complex website without any framework.

KLIND OS doesn't use any JavaScript framework except JQuery if you count that.
JQuery is only used because we use JQuery-UI for draggable and resizable windows.

# Is KLIND OS secure?

**No**, KLIND OS is **not secure**. All external apps have access to all your files
and can do anything, just like the system.

I plan to make KLIND OS more secure in the future.

Linux is just a "bootloader" for Electron app that is KLIND OS.
