KLIND OS is not maintained as much as before. Why? Because of school.

Recently I started to attend a new school and I do not have as much time for open-source as before. Or I'm working on other projects.

But KLIND OS isn't going to be archived, I will continue to do some changes from time to time. But it will not be as much as before.

Thanks,
